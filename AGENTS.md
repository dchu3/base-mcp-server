# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
TypeScript sources live in `src/`, with `index.ts` bootstrapping the MCP server, `server.ts` registering tools, and focused modules such as `blockscout.ts`, `tools/`, `config.ts`, and `routers.ts` handling API, validation, and routing concerns. Reusable helpers belong in `utils.ts` to keep handlers slim. Tests mirror this layout under `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`, while automation scripts go in `scripts/` (for example `scripts/dev.sh` and `scripts/build.sh`). Keep generated bundles inside `dist/` and exclude them from commits.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use Node.js 20+. Install dependencies with `npm install`. During development run `npm run dev` (tsx watch) or `npm run start` for the compiled bundle. Build distributables with `npm run build` (tsup). Validate code quality via `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check`. Execute the test suite with `npm run test`, and add `--runInBand` when debugging integration hits against live Blockscout endpoints.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the repository ESLint and Prettier configs: 2-space indentation, semicolons enabled, single quotes in TypeScript, and sorted imports where practical. Exported types/interfaces use `PascalCase`, functions and variables use `camelCase`, and constants are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only when truly immutable. Co-locate zod schemas with their handlers in `tools/` and prefer explicit return types for exported functions. Run `npm run format` before pushing.

## Testing Guidelines
Vitest is the primary framework. Unit specs belong in `tests/unit/<module>.spec.ts` and integration flows in `tests/integration/`, guarded by environment flags when hitting real APIs. Aim for 90%+ line coverage on pure utility and schema modules; justify gaps in PR notes when external latency or rate limits apply. Mock Blockscout responses to keep CI deterministic, and snapshot only stable payloads.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commit subjects in the imperative mood (e.g., `Add Blockscout client retries`) and keep them under 72 characters. Group related changes together; avoid mixing formatting and feature work in one commit. Pull requests should describe the user-facing impact, list relevant environment variables, and link issues when available. Include screenshots or CLI transcripts if behavior changes. Confirm that lint, format, and tests succeed locally before requesting review.

## Configuration & Environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local work. Document new keys inline and set sensible defaults so `npm run dev` works without manual tweaks. Respect `BASE_NETWORK` switching between mainnet and Base Sepolia, and allow overrides via CLI flags or env variables without code changes. When adding secrets or tokens, never commit themâ€”use placeholders and update the sample file instead.
